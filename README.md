# Contact-Manager-App-Node_backend

In this project, I developed a Contact Manager application that enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their contacts. I gained valuable insights into various concepts and their practical implementation.

The project includes setting up an Express server and connecting it to a MongoDB database. I implemented RESTful API routes for managing contacts and users. This involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts, as well as user registration, login, and authentication using JWT tokens.

The project emphasizes error handling, security, and middleware usage to ensure a robust and secure application. The end result is a fully functional Contact Manager application with user authentication and secure routes for managing contacts.
